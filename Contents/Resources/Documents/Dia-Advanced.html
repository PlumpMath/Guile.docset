<h4 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.7 Going Further with Dia and Guile</h4>

<p>The steps described so far implement an initial Guile integration that
already gives a lot of additional power to Dia application users.  But
there are further steps that you could take, and it&rsquo;s interesting to
consider a few of these.
</p>
<p>In general, you could progressively move more of Dia&rsquo;s source code from
C into Scheme.  This might make the code more maintainable and
extensible, and it could open the door to new programming paradigms that
are tricky to effect in C but straightforward in Scheme.
</p>
<p>A specific example of this is that you could use the guile-gtk package,
which provides Scheme-level procedures for most of the Gtk+ library, to
move the code that lays out and displays Dia objects from C to Scheme.
</p>
<p>As you follow this path, it naturally becomes less useful to maintain a
distinction between Dia&rsquo;s original non-Guile-related source code, and
its later code implementing SMOBs and primitives for the Scheme world.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the original source code had a
<code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> function:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">void dia_change_fill_pattern (struct dia_shape * shape,
                              struct dia_pattern * pattern)
{
  /* real pattern change work */
}
</pre></div>

<p>During initial Guile integration, you add a <code>change_fill_pattern</code>
primitive for Scheme purposes, which accesses the underlying structures
from its SMOB values and uses <code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> to do the
real work:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">SCM change_fill_pattern (SCM shape, SCM pattern)
{
  struct dia_shape * d_shape;
  struct dia_pattern * d_pattern;

  &hellip;

  dia_change_fill_pattern (d_shape, d_pattern);

  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}
</pre></div>

<p>At this point, it makes sense to keep <code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> and
<code>change_fill_pattern</code> separate, because
<code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> can also be called without going through
Scheme at all, say because the user clicks a button which causes a
C-registered Gtk+ callback to be called.
</p>
<p>But, if the code for creating buttons and registering their callbacks is
moved into Scheme (using guile-gtk), it may become true that
<code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> can no longer be called other than
through Scheme.  In which case, it makes sense to abolish it and move
its contents directly into <code>change_fill_pattern</code>, like this:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">SCM change_fill_pattern (SCM shape, SCM pattern)
{
  struct dia_shape * d_shape;
  struct dia_pattern * d_pattern;

  &hellip;

  /* real pattern change work */

  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}
</pre></div>

<p>So further Guile integration progressively <em>reduces</em> the amount of
functional C code that you have to maintain over the long term.
</p>
<p>A similar argument applies to data representation.  In the discussion of
SMOBs earlier, issues arose because of the different memory management
and lifetime models that normally apply to data structures in C and in
Scheme.  However, with further Guile integration, you can resolve this
issue in a more radical way by allowing all your data structures to be
under the control of the garbage collector, and kept alive by references
from the Scheme world.  Instead of maintaining an array or linked list
of shapes in C, you would instead maintain a list in Scheme.
</p>
<p>Rather like the coalescing of <code>dia_change_fill_pattern</code> and
<code>change_fill_pattern</code>, the practical upshot of such a change is
that you would no longer have to keep the <code>dia_shape</code> and
<code>dia_guile_shape</code> structures separate, and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to
worry about the pointers between them.  Instead, you could change the
SMOB definition to wrap the <code>dia_shape</code> structure directly, and
send <code>dia_guile_shape</code> off to the scrap yard.  Cut out the middle
man!
</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the holy grail of Guile&rsquo;s free software / extension
language approach.  Once you have a Scheme representation for
interesting Dia data types like shapes, and a handy bunch of primitives
for manipulating them, it suddenly becomes clear that you have a bundle
of functionality that could have far-ranging use beyond Dia itself.  In
other words, the data types and primitives could now become a library,
and Dia becomes just one of the many possible applications using that
library &mdash; albeit, at this early stage, a rather important one!
</p>
<p>In this model, Guile becomes just the glue that binds everything
together.  Imagine an application that usefully combined functionality
from Dia, Gnumeric and GnuCash &mdash; it&rsquo;s tricky right now, because no
such application yet exists; but it&rsquo;ll happen some day &hellip;
