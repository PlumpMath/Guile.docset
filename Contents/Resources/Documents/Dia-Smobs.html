<h4 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.3 How to Represent Dia Data in Scheme</h4>

<p>For all but the most trivial applications, you will probably want to
allow some representation of your domain objects to exist on the Scheme
level.  This is where the idea of SMOBs comes in, and with it issues of
lifetime management and garbage collection.
</p>
<p>To get more concrete about this, let&rsquo;s look again at the example we gave
earlier of how application users can use Guile to build higher-level
functions from the primitives that Dia itself provides.
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define (change-squares'-fill-pattern new-pattern)
  (for-each-shape current-page
    (lambda (shape)
      (if (square? shape)
          (change-fill-pattern shape new-pattern)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Consider what is stored here in the variable <code>shape</code>.  For each
shape on the current page, the <code>for-each-shape</code> primitive calls
<code>(lambda (shape) &hellip;)</code> with an argument representing that
shape.  Question is: how is that argument represented on the Scheme
level?  The issues are as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Whatever the representation, it has to be decodable again by the C code
for the <code>square?</code> and <code>change-fill-pattern</code> primitives.  In
other words, a primitive like <code>square?</code> has somehow to be able to
turn the value that it receives back into something that points to the
underlying C structure describing a shape.

</li><li> The representation must also cope with Scheme code holding on to the
value for later use.  What happens if the Scheme code stores
<code>shape</code> in a global variable, but then that shape is deleted (in a
way that the Scheme code is not aware of), and later on some other
Scheme code uses that global variable again in a call to, say,
<code>square?</code>?

</li><li> The lifetime and memory allocation of objects that exist <em>only</em> in
the Scheme world is managed automatically by Guile&rsquo;s garbage collector
using one simple rule: when there are no remaining references to an
object, the object is considered dead and so its memory is freed.  But
for objects that exist in both C and Scheme, the picture is more
complicated; in the case of Dia, where the <code>shape</code> argument passes
transiently in and out of the Scheme world, it would be quite wrong the
<strong>delete</strong> the underlying C shape just because the Scheme code has
finished evaluation.  How do we avoid this happening?
</li></ul>

<p>One resolution of these issues is for the Scheme-level representation of
a shape to be a new, Scheme-specific C structure wrapped up as a SMOB.
The SMOB is what is passed into and out of Scheme code, and the
Scheme-specific C structure inside the SMOB points to Dia&rsquo;s underlying C
structure so that the code for primitives like <code>square?</code> can get at
it.
</p>
<p>To cope with an underlying shape being deleted while Scheme code is
still holding onto a Scheme shape value, the underlying C structure
should have a new field that points to the Scheme-specific SMOB.  When a
shape is deleted, the relevant code chains through to the
Scheme-specific structure and sets its pointer back to the underlying
structure to NULL.  Thus the SMOB value for the shape continues to
exist, but any primitive code that tries to use it will detect that the
underlying shape has been deleted because the underlying structure
pointer is NULL.
</p>
<p>So, to summarize the steps involved in this resolution of the problem
(and assuming that the underlying C structure for a shape is
<code>struct dia_shape</code>):
</p>
<ul>
<li> Define a new Scheme-specific structure that <em>points</em> to the
underlying C structure:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">struct dia_guile_shape
{
  struct dia_shape * c_shape;   /* NULL =&gt; deleted */
}
</pre></div>

</li><li> Add a field to <code>struct dia_shape</code> that points to its <code>struct
dia_guile_shape</code> if it has one &mdash;

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">struct dia_shape
{
  &hellip;
  struct dia_guile_shape * guile_shape;
}
</pre></div>

<p>&mdash; so that C code can set <code>guile_shape-&gt;c_shape</code> to NULL when the
underlying shape is deleted.
</p>
</li><li> Wrap <code>struct dia_guile_shape</code> as a SMOB type.

</li><li> Whenever you need to represent a C shape onto the Scheme level, create a
SMOB instance for it, and pass that.

</li><li> In primitive code that receives a shape SMOB instance, check the
<code>c_shape</code> field when decoding it, to find out whether the
underlying C shape is still there.
</li></ul>

<p>As far as memory management is concerned, the SMOB values and their
Scheme-specific structures are under the control of the garbage
collector, whereas the underlying C structures are explicitly managed in
exactly the same way that Dia managed them before we thought of adding
Guile.
</p>
<p>When the garbage collector decides to free a shape SMOB value, it calls
the <em>SMOB free</em> function that was specified when defining the shape
SMOB type.  To maintain the correctness of the <code>guile_shape</code> field
in the underlying C structure, this function should chain through to the
underlying C structure (if it still exists) and set its
<code>guile_shape</code> field to NULL.
</p>
