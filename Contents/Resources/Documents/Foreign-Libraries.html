<h4 class="subsection">6.20.1 Foreign Libraries</h4>

<p>Most modern Unices have something called <em>shared libraries</em>.  This
ordinarily means that they have the capability to share the executable
image of a library between several running programs to save memory and
disk space.  But generally, shared libraries give a lot of additional
flexibility compared to the traditional static libraries.  In fact,
calling them &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; libraries is as correct as calling them &lsquo;shared&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Shared libraries really give you a lot of flexibility in addition to the
memory and disk space savings.  When you link a program against a shared
library, that library is not closely incorporated into the final
executable.  Instead, the executable of your program only contains
enough information to find the needed shared libraries when the program
is actually run.  Only then, when the program is starting, is the final
step of the linking process performed.  This means that you need not
recompile all programs when you install a new, only slightly modified
version of a shared library.  The programs will pick up the changes
automatically the next time they are run.
</p>
<p>Now, when all the necessary machinery is there to perform part of the
linking at run-time, why not take the next step and allow the programmer
to explicitly take advantage of it from within his program?  Of course,
many operating systems that support shared libraries do just that, and
chances are that Guile will allow you to access this feature from within
your Scheme programs.  As you might have guessed already, this feature
is called <em>dynamic linking</em>.<a name="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a>
</p>
<p>We titled this section &ldquo;foreign libraries&rdquo; because although the name
&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t leak into the API, the world of C really is foreign
to Scheme &ndash; and that estrangement extends to components of foreign
libraries as well, as we see in future sections.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-dynamic_002dlink"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>dynamic-link</strong> <em>[library]</em></dt>
<dt><a name="index-scm_005fdynamic_005flink"></a>C Function: <strong>scm_dynamic_link</strong> <em>(library)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Find the shared library denoted by <var>library</var> (a string) and link it
into the running Guile application.  When everything works out, return a
Scheme object suitable for representing the linked object file.
Otherwise an error is thrown.  How object files are searched is system
dependent.
</p>
<p>Normally, <var>library</var> is just the name of some shared library file
that will be searched for in the places where shared libraries usually
reside, such as in <samp>/usr/lib</samp> and <samp>/usr/local/lib</samp>.
</p>
<p><var>library</var> should not contain an extension such as <code>.so</code>.  The
correct file name extension for the host operating system is provided
automatically, according to libltdl&rsquo;s rules (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Libltdl-interface.html#Libltdl-interface"><code>lt_dlopenext</code></a> in <cite>Shared Library Support for
GNU</cite>).
</p>
<p>When <var>library</var> is omitted, a <em>global symbol handle</em> is returned.  This
handle provides access to the symbols available to the program at run-time,
including those exported by the program itself and the shared libraries already
loaded.
</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>obj</var> is a dynamic library handle, or <code>#f</code>
otherwise.
</p></dd></dl>

<dt><a name="index-dynamic_002dunlink"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>dynamic-unlink</strong> <em>dobj</em></dt>
<dt><a name="index-scm_005fdynamic_005funlink"></a>C Function: <strong>scm_dynamic_unlink</strong> <em>(dobj)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Unlink the indicated object file from the application.  The
argument <var>dobj</var> must have been obtained by a call to
<code>dynamic-link</code>.  After <code>dynamic-unlink</code> has been
called on <var>dobj</var>, its content is no longer accessible.
</p></dd></dl>

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">(define libgl-obj (dynamic-link &quot;libGL&quot;))
libgl-obj
&rArr; #&lt;dynamic-object &quot;libGL&quot;&gt;
(dynamic-unlink libGL-obj)
libGL-obj
&rArr; #&lt;dynamic-object &quot;libGL&quot; (unlinked)&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, after calling <code>dynamic-unlink</code> on a dynamically
linked library, it is marked as &lsquo;<samp>(unlinked)</samp>&rsquo; and you are no longer
able to use it with <code>dynamic-call</code>, etc.  Whether the library is
really removed from you program is system-dependent and will generally
not happen when some other parts of your program still use it.
</p>
<p>When dynamic linking is disabled or not supported on your system,
the above functions throw errors, but they are still available.

<h3><a name="FOOT18" href="#DOCF18">(18)</a></h3>
<p>Some people also refer to the
final linking stage at program startup as &lsquo;dynamic linking&rsquo;, so if you
want to make yourself perfectly clear, it is probably best to use the
more technical term <em>dlopening</em>, as suggested by Gordon Matzigkeit
in his libtool documentation.</p>
